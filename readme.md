# Simple discord music playing bot

Made quickly coz YT been at it taking down the public music bots, has simple functionality with queuing
Uhh probs won't work a lot on it as there are many better ones out there on github but yeah...

replace token in config.json with your bot's token, you probably should setup the bot first on discordapp...
